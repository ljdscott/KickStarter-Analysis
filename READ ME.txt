Kickstarter analysis is to review various Kickstarter projects from around the world. The main Kickstarter spreadsheet includes information such as country, outcome, length of project, budget and ect. This project looked very closely at the various factors that may directly or indirectly effect the outcome.  This analysis could help someone looking into crowd funding as a viable option for performing arts productions. 
This challenge included several excel functions such as a pivot chart, line graph, filters and creating new tables from the original; Each function provided a new perspective to the data. Some difficulties found encounter were experimenting with the pivot tables and where to place the information in the table. Understanding how placing labels in the each section of the chart will display vastly different and possibly the paint a different picture. Difficulties with the line graphs were the default line colors were not consistent. The filters were very convenient when trying to make a graph or chart.  Challenges with the filters were remembering to change them to the default settings after completing a task. Maneuvering the filters Definitely effecting the accuracy when trying to create new charts as well. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis very unique as it  looks at the when  campaigns open which lead one to wonder if the timeframe of the campaign effect outcomes.  Each subcategory can be isolated this this can be view separately. Does month/ quarter effect outcome, are some categories more successful than others.  When reviewing each category, that the first two quarters had most success campaigns. Theater is one of the most popular categories with 60 percent success rate. With this, 1/3 of all successful campaigns started in the second quarter. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
An analysis of goals will decode which weather the pledge amount of the campaign will effect it out come. Difficulties in creating this table was obtaining the required information to analyze. Cancelled campaigns were lost during the process and therefore that information could not be use for this analysis which may have skewed the results and accompanying graph.  Based on the information available the category with the most campaigns had goals of $1000 or less, however the most successful campaigns were between $5000- $9999.  A few categories has 100%  success rate but due to the low number to campaigns (single digits), this may not be realistic is when trying to determine factors and influences on outcomes. 






Challenges encountered were losing data during the various manipulations. Information on Cancelled campaigns were lost on the Kickstarter Excel sheet. This heavily skewed results when analyzing outcomes. Also remembering to manipulate filters and return them to their standard setting after use.  Utilizing the “countifs” formula posed to be difficult when trying to set the ranges. 
Conclusion that can drawn  would be Campaigns launched in the first 2 quarters are the most successful across  several categories. Limitations of data sets include the lost data of cancelled campaigns.  Also limitations don’t include the total length of campaign.  While the outcomes could include which amounts, they do indicate category.
